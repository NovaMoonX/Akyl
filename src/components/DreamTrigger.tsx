            Until starting this project in 2025, I would draft up my budget in a
            Google Doc. Just a list of my monthly expenses, along with a few
            other important matters â€” you know, like saving goals. This worked
            for a while (literally since 2020), but it started to feel clunky.
            Too many sections, too many bullet points, too much scrolling. I
            wanted something more visual, more intuitive to understand and
            explore. And that became Akyl, a simple, yet powerful budgeting tool
            that helps you see the bigger picture.
