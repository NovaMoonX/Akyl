## About the Project
This web application helps you understand your personal finances in a clear, visual way. Instead of just numbers, you'll build a dynamic flowchart that shows how your money flows from your income sources to various spending categories and savings goals.

## Background
If you're anything like me, you sometimes you have to stop and ask yourself: where does the money go? It's a question of budget, and there are many ways to go about it: spreadsheets, apps (i.e. YNAB), envelope system, handwritten notes, or even just purely by memory. Each approach has its upsides and drawbacks. And for a person such as myself who does a budget every once in a while and doesn't need the thoroughness of an app, having all of my income and expense "buckets" in place is perfect. To see it visually (rather than just text in a doc)? Now that's fantastic.

## Key Features:
- **Top-to-Bottom Flowchart:** Visually map your income and expenses.
- **Period Views:** See your financial overview during any general period (i.e weekly, monthly, annually)
- **Private and Safe:** Your information is stored entirely in your browser, so it is 100% private. 
- **Save & Load Progress:** Download your budget as a file _or_ image. Files can be uploaded to resume planning.
